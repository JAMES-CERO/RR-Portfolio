        <p> They say an alligator is so ferocious it'd kill a lion,
             but i can kill an alligator with my bare hands </p>
         How?, you kill it right after it eats.
            because right after eats it gets satisfied and it goes to a state 
            like it is almost paralyzed.
        
        ARE YOU PARALIZED?
         You have a little succes ? You've done what nobody else in your
             family has done & now your chilling?  
         Come on!, you aint hungry no more ?  YOU SHOULD STILL BE HUNGRY!

        <h3> As a child, I joined the Boy Scouts where I learned important survival skills, how to care for the environment, and the value of teamwork. As a Lion-Wolf, I honed my problem-solving abilities to tackle real-life challenges. Growing up with access to a variety of technologies, I managed my parents' cyber cafe at the age of 17. This experience helped me realize my strong Mathematics abilities and aptitude for learning, which spurred my interest in pursuing a tech career.

Unfortunately, economic challenges arose, and my family was hit hard. Despite the difficulties, I remained determined to build the life and career I always wanted. I left home and started anew, working hard to overcome the challenges and pursue my passions. While the journey was not always easy, it has taught me the importance of resilience, determination, and perseverance. </h3>
